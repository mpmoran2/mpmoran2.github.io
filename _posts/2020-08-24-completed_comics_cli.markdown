A summary and Walkthrough of my ruby CLI project for the 07/27 Cohort

# Languages/Tools/Gems 
OOR, Ruby, Open-uri, Pry, Nokogiri

# What is Completed Comics?
Completed Commics is an app that scraped Webtoon for their completed comics and giving them to the user by genre.


# Features

* Scraped URL with deeply nested elements with Nokogiri
* Used class and instance methods to process data
* Used conditionals and logic for input using integers for ease of use

# Obstacles
1) The entire build as a whole. 
* It was overwhelming because this was my first time making a ruby code from absolute scratch. Not to mention I had never used my local enviroment past setting it up previously so linking it to GitHub on top of that was absolutly terrifying (and exciting)

2) Figuring out the gems. 
* I looked up a few so that I could make it prettier but learning that on top of everything else, I got things confused a few times and decided to stick to basics.

3) Asking for help. 
* It seems silly but admiting I'm stuck and being convinced people will hate me/not help is like a goblin holding me hostage. Even allowing myself to watch all the various videos of walkthroughs was hard for me to do until near the end when I was desperate. 
* It is ok to need help and ask for it and use all the resources given.

4) Over thinking. 
* This is the biggest bane of my coding exsistance. I would start simple and then go completly and utterly complecated after wards. It took a long meeting with 3 of my peers (seriously the best people) and technical advisors (MVP Juan thanks for dealing with my over thinking self) to get me through it.

5) Breaks and rest. 
* During this I...was not sleeping. Staying up late turned into a few days without sleep and that? That was the thing that hurt me the most. I was going in circles so even with assistance I was not getting anywhere because my body was over it and so was my brain. 
* When you're stuck, get some water, get some food, and sleep. It helps a lot.
* Remember: We are the most important computer for building code

# Joys
1) Looking up different gems to make the CLI nicer was fun. TTY-Prompt and HTTParty are ones I would love to try out and learn when I'm not going crazy over a project. 

2) Despite the stress (self inflicted) the joys of any little victory really outweighed everything 

3) This inspired me to try making my own personal CLI for the daily ongoing schedule to let you know whats been updated each day/week 

4) Unless they change their HTML code or URL this will constantly grow as more comics get completed! 
# Over All
While I am nervous that I did not do enough, that it isn't good enough, that I could have done more if I had asked for help earlier, I loved this and know I can only learn and grow from the entire experience.
