Starting Tuesdays, I will be kicking off Technical Tuesdays, a weekly blog post chronicalling my journey to expand my technical knowledge, be it through learning something new or by review of a skill I have.

This month, using Udemy, I will be learning and teaching myself the language as well as how to use is with Django, Tkinter, Flask, and Web Scraping.

Now, why did I choose Python? Well, from my job search so far, Python seems to be the more dominant language vs Ruby. An industry standard from what I can see. Does this mean that I think Python is better? Not necessarily. While it seems to be required or at bare minimum prefered over Ruby in many Software Engineer job listings, I think that they are both wonderful, it just depends on how and where you're using it, like any other coding language.

From my research about Python, here are some things that I'm excited about Python:
* It is more direct and easy to use, expecially with Linux (and thankfully a similar syntax to Ruby). 
* Google and Instagram themselves use Python, which peaks my interest, especially in the User aspect of the respective companies' codes. 
* The community is stable and diverse and less likely to break as it innovates at a slower pace than Ruby
* Philosophy: Python focuses on an ease of learning by having a set way to do things

Things I'm a bit nervous about as I go into learning Python:
* With how explicit the code can be, the crux of overthinking things will be a block I need to overcome
* Learning completly on my own with no real back and forth with an instructor will be a new experience

Over all, I'm ridiculously excited to learn a new coding language that will make me a better coder in the long run.
