Its about to be December tomorrow. The final month of our bootcamp for 07/27/2020 Full Time cohort. It's a bit unnerving to be honest. It doesn't feel that long ago that we were starting out but now we're at the home stretch. It's been a journey between thinking "Was this a mistake? Am I even smart enough for this?" to "Yes! I passed that technical review" and making notes of what to work on for next time.

I've made some great friends through all of this, learned how to communicate, learned how to pair code and work through the bugs. It's been a chaotic but steady distraction from the current world state and I'm thankful for being here. So on to React and the final Technical Review and then on to a new life and career.
