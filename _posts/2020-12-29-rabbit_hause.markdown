A Summary and Walkthrough of my React/Redux Project for the 07/27 Cohor

# Languages
* Backend  - Ruby on Rails API 
* Frontend - React/Redux

# What is Rabbit Hause
Rabbit Hause is an application that assists users in keeping a log of habits they are trying to learn. As it takes anywhere from 18-256 consecutive days to make a habit automatic, Rabbit Hause allows users to see how many days they've compleated in a streak.
# Features
* Habit Creation and Updating
* Tracking Daily Streaks
* Ability to log and delete days a habit is done
* Gentle Rabbit Theme to encourage a less overwhelming way to track habits
# Obstacles
1. Installation and error Issues
* While creating the application, a vauge error came up. My fetch() was grabbing the HTML from index.html. All the solutions told me it was webpack issue or a json corruption or symply had vauge "It could be anything" answers. It was the worst roadblock and almost had be give up, I was so stressed about it. Finally, it was figured out thanks to a cohort/pod member who was my other eyes.
2. Asking for help
* I should know better than to stall for help but I was so stubborn about it that it nearly did me in. A silly obstacle but the biggest one I have still
3. Holiday Blues
* While it isn't as much a coding Obstacle, I found that in this holiday season + the first real holiday after a loved one has passed, it really put into perspective that even if life is hard, one needs to find a way to work around it and communicate so that it doesnt impead in project, be it academic, work, or personal.


# Joys
1.  Error Fueled Coding
* Other than the first error that stalled me the longest, I still enjoy the error fueled coding, especially when the answers are out there and not vauger than the spiderweb that gets you when you walk to your car.
 2. Collaboration
 * When I finally was about to ask for help, it took 2 hours together vs the 2 weeks alone to get the error as my pod member had experienced the same error as well. It was exciting to talke about how he fixed his error and see where mine was thanks to his experience dealing with it as well.
# Over All
Through everything I'm happy I was able to create this. Going forward, it is going to be one of my fun codes that I can work on to make better and try new things. While the look is basic, I'm proud of what I made.
