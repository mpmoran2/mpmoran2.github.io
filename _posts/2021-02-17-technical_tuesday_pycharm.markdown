Learning Python, one of the things I've been using is the PyCharm IDE. Honestly, there are a lot of functions I really enjoy!

One of the things I deeply enjoy about using Pycharm is that you can use the console in a popup. No comman line to start it, its just another tab to test something out real quick. It is nice when one is first learning Python. No having two seperate windows with the console and PyCharm (as I take notes in PyCharm and use the console to see how things are working in real time.) 

Another which is even nicer is the git tab! At the top right corner, there are some icons for updating, committing, and pushing your project to the git repo you made for it. While it is a small thing, it just DELIGHTS me because it can be rather tedious to use the git commands in the terminal. It saves time and it makes it easier to remember to commit and push your work (something I've learned is easily forgotten when you're in a groove.) and can save one from the horror of a computer crash and loosing what you were working on. 

PyCharm is intuitive enough if one is like me and started with VS Code but the small things that Pycharm adds to be more functional and allow for less windows open while working on something shows how importand function and design is with software creation. It is obvious JetBrains took time to make the IDE easier for the user be it debugging, commiting, or playing in the console to see if an idea will work with just a click. 

As I learn more and more of Python, I am excited to see what else PyCharm can do to make the experience easier.
