A Summary and Walkthrough of my Rails Project for the 07/27 Cohor

# Languages
Ruby on Rails

# What is Radiant Routines
Radiant Routines is a site to log all the products you own/use for skincare as well as keep track of your routines (and how much each one takes you.
# Features
* User Accounts
* Log In via GitHub
* Users can only edit and delete own products and routines and steps withing routines
* View only what user creates
# Obstacles
1.  The nested routes
* While creating the routes was easy, when it came to the create and edit methods and the links to their views, that reall got me for a good few hours. Its a simple thing but so easy to overthink and over code.
2.  The third party authentication
* Getting the login to work, it was more tedious because of the many things to do to get it working. It doesn't take long but it does in the form of getting things to save as a user if going through GitHub to login
3.  Partial forms
* It was frustrating to get forms to work. Some worked with the standard layout of partial others requierd a bit more of a round about. It was fun to see and implement but frustrating of "You worked for this controller, why?!"

# Joys
1.  Error Fueled Coding
* It was incredibly fun and satisfying to get and error and get it working to hit a new error, even if sometimes I wanted to pull out my hair (good thing I shave my head right?)
2.  Validation of Knowledge
* Starting it, I tend to think "This is the project I fail." However, this project was "Oh...I know this? I got through this well....oh...I'm almost done?!" 
3.  Community
* While working on this I relied on my Pod and friends made in the cohort to be someones eyes and have extra eyes of "Help me with this syntaxx." or simply "Hey I can help with that, let me look for you I bet it's syntax". Celebrating eachother's wins and talking out code to prep each other for reviews kept me sane and going. It felt like how working as a SE could be. Working on your own things but still being there and supporting each other and encouraging each other.

# Over All
While things have been stressful in the real world, I'm finding coding to be more than just a skill and job but a therapy. This project validated that I am smart, that I can create things, and as hard as it is for me to remember technical terms and verbalize, treating it more as fun than an exam is what it really is. Learning to do something I love even if at times it drives me up the wall.
