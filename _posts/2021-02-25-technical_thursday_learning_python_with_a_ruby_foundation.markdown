As someone who started off learning Ruby, Python was my first goal to learn a technical skill on my own between the job hunt. Knowing that Python was very similar to Ruby, I went in with the mindset that Python was just a more direct version of Ruby. While that isn't completly wrong, I think going into learning Python with that mindset is what makes learning a little harder than it should be.

Why does it make it harder? Because I naievely thought of is as "more direct ruby" vs its own distinct language. Granted I know it is a different languages but that view makes it hard to switch mindests when learning. An example, syntax. It is like Java and Ruby had a child and with my previous mindset, it was hard to get around because the distint urge to use Ruby syntax was a roadblock. 

It makes me wonder how many others have had that block with what should have been smoother learning but previous languages and similarities became the spikes in the road so to speak. How do we get around it when we see those similarities and if we aren't 100% focused other languages sneak into that learning? It reminds me of doing a fullstack project. Needing to hone that skill of switching between languages in a moment when working both front and back end seems to translate into learning new languages as well.
