I'm 29 next week and Covid-19 really turned things around. I was in accounting, an AP Clerk at a growing General Contractor and things were ok. I had a paycheck, I had a decent job. Was working on a certificate in bookkeeping. But I wasn't happy. 

It wasn't something that I chose but more fell into because of family connections. As Covid began, I turned to TikTok as a source of light hearted distraction and a creator mentioned FlatIron School. I looked it up and immidiatly remembered how much I had wanted to code. How I fell in love and learned HTML and CSS for layouts for places like MySpace and Tumbler when I was younger. Honestly? I never thought I was smart enough to do coding but I started to look into it. Dabbled more into it, researched the school but, I was working Full Time. 

Then my mother died of a stroke in March, the day Covid Lock Down began nation wide. Then the beginning of May? I was let go from my job. I had no idea what I was going to do with my life and I remembered FlatIron. I decided, I wasn't going to sit in my grief, that is not what my mother would have wanted. I was going to better myself and follow my old dreams of working in tech and creating things with code. I applied to Flatiron and took a coding certification on Coursera and really fell in love with it. 

This is what I wanted. Something that was challenging but so fun, something where I was actually doing something, no dealing with over machismo men yelling about money and coperate office politics. I felt happy. Even when I wanted to throw my computer because the code was being, well, code. It was a puzzle and I love puzzles. It was a chance to do something I love and work in an industry I admire, a chance to make a decent living as well so that I could do the one thing my mom ever wanted for me. Be able to comfortably live and be happy.

So chose software engineering because it gives me an opportunity to work on applications, websites, etc for companies that bring happiness to people. From music apps to banking, its something that is useful and every evolving. It can provide neccessary daily life apps to apps that just help escape from a crazy world or stressful work day and I think that its amazing that the tech industry and software engineers allow that for the rest of the world. So here I am and hoping that my faith in myself to be smart enough to graduate is right.
