A Summary and Walkthrough of myJavaScript/Rails project for the 07/27 Cohor

# Languages
Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Html/CSS

# What is Mom's Kitchen
Mom's Kitchen is a single page wep app that is a homage to my late mother who passed this year. It randomly generates a recipe from the recipes she taught me/would cook for me (or in the rare cases something she loved that I made) as a way to keep her memory alive and cook with her in a way. 
# Features
* Ability to add Recipes and Ingredients along with an associated memory of Mama 
* Random generation of a recipe from the database
# Obstacles
1.  The nested routes
2.  Switching between Ruby and JavaScript mentally at the drop of a hat
3.  Refractoring

# Joys
1.  Error Fueled Coding
2.  Validation of Knowledge
3.  Puzzle Like Challenge


# Over All
Overall this was one of the hardest projects I've done but the most satisfying to see it come into fruition. I'm glad I was able to get a better idea of what jobs will look like and how to better manage my time, thinking, strucure, and communication and happy to have done a project of catharsis.
