A Summary and Walkthrough of my SinatraI project for the 07/27 Cohor

# Languages
OOR, Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS

# What is Party In The DnD
Party In The DnD is a simple application to view all your DnD characters to see who you may want for your next campaign as well as hold all your NPCs for DMs to easily keep track of.
# Features
* User Accounts
* See other's characters as well (great for DMs who need some more NPCs) 
* Users can only edit and delete own characters
# Obstacles
1) The biggest obstacle I faces was the sheer volume of code. Not knowing where to start is always an issue of mine even if I have a skeleton written out of how I want to do things/what files I'll need/all that fun jazz. Learning to rely on my fellow cohort members and cohort leads is the biggest thing.

2) In that thought of overwhelmed by the amount of code and languages, realizing pull requests, even if its from a friend or cohort lead and asking "Hey, I'm getting this error. Can you be my other eyes and tell me if I'm not seeing something?" is a BIG help and can save you so much time and grief. It helps when they can go "Yeah its this syntax" or "You're overthinking/complicating it. Take a break"

3) ActiveRecord tables when you need to join then. Theoretically I know what needs to be done but needing to chart them in an Exel Table so that its just a little less brain power to see a physical representation of what needs to join where. 

4)  CSS. One moment it doesnt want to work and you have to do all your changes in each view page. The next moment it decided to work and its refractoring time again. 

# Joys
1) While my application is nothing novel, it was really fun to see the beginnings of how some of my favorite DnD sites form when it comes to displaying everything. It gives perpective to how really great websites and webapps are created and all that goes into a lot of what we may take for granted. 

2) The fun and laughter from debugging with an extra pair of eyes. Sometimes that "Are you kidding me?!" and then laughing over it really helps break up the stress that can come from it all. 

3) That sweet sweet moment of victory when one error passes. Even if it brings up a new error somewhere else. It's progress.

# Over All
This time I didn't hours of help and that fealt really great. Learning from the resources given as like....background noise and structure was a life saver along with our friend Google. 

I'm happy that I got to see this turn from an idea to something useable and from here, it got me excited to learn more so that I can make it a life long project for fun.
