Another week of self learning! To be honest, learning Python has been interesting and not nearly as stressful as I thought it would be. For a moment, I worried that maybe I should start with C++ or C# as I have an interest in game coding but I think starting with a language that is similar to what I know now was the right decision. 

Self learning is different than the more structured learning that I did at Flatiron. Not completly different, as we did do our labs mostly on our own if we chose to but the time frame is different. This is true self paced work and its actually exciting! Thankfully there is some communication with the course professor but its mostly just recorded and transcribed lessons. 

One thing that will be interesting is that I will be using JetBrains PyCharm IDE to do most of my coding but I will experiment with VSCode to see how the two differ and what I prefer from each. 

Using the Python Console was new as well. Starting with a command line exercise, the syntax is already very like Ruby which makes the transition easier.  However, formulas are much more explicit and to the point which is both nice but also threw me off as I still think in Ruby at times and over think it.

Another thing I realized is that there is a bit of ego that happens when learning a new language that is insanely similar to one you may already know. You may want to skip through things or breeze through it without really looking through and going through the exercises but that (in my opinion) is a mistake. Does it take more time? Yes! Is it worth doing tho? Also yes! I'm seeing that no matter what you think you know, the fundementals of how the language works is so important for the long haul.
